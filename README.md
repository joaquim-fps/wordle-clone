# Wordle Clone App

A version of the Wordle app using vanilla js/css. It gets a random word from a word list every time you reload the page and there's a new game button too.

## Improvements to be done

-   Fetch random word from an API to reduce load times. Currently, the word list is from Webster's English Dictionary and is stored locally.
-   Implement hard mode, where you need to use previous clues.
